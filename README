This is a fork of https://github.com/gothfox/Tiny-Tiny-RSS-for-Honeycomb
customized for my own service, including embedded self signed cert
and removal of the trial ware.

For information on the original software goto:

and if desired pay the original developer a donation (as he is
also the core dev of the web service)
